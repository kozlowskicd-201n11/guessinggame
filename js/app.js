Questions about me:

3. During introductions on the first day of class, I mentioned that I play a musical instrument.  Was that instrument the electric guitar? -- NO!  Close, but it's the electric bass.
2. Is my all time favorite movie The Godfather? -- NO!  I like some levity with my movie watching.  My all-time favorite is The Big Lebowski.
3. Have I ever been to New York City? -- YES!  I spent a week and a half in New York City as a part of Fleet Week while in the military.
4. Do I have any pets?  -- NO!  I love animals but do not have a pet at the moment.  My roommates have a dog, 2 cats, and 5 chickens though, so I'm covered on animal companionship right now.
5. Is is true that my mom I have driven across the country in 2 and a half days? -- YES!  My last duty station was in North Carolina and I needed to get home somehow!
